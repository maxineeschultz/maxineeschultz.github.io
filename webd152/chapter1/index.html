<h3> My Favorite Beverage </h3>
<p>
My favorite drink tends to vary depending on the current season.
For example, right now I really enjoy drinking tea 
at nigh before bed because I like to consume
something that is warm in the cold winter time. I am
currently a huge fan of this lavender camomile tea that
that I bought at the store this week. I love the taste 
and smell of lavender and the combination of lavender
and camomile has improved my quality of sleep.
