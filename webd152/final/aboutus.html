              <p>
                We aim to give back to the Earth as much as we can. Our Yurts
                are safe and efficient structures that use minimal materials to
                construct and are equipped with lights and outlets powered by
                solar energy. Though we utilize renewable energy, we ensure that
                your vacation experience is eco-friendly while also being
                comfortable and luxurious.
